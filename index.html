<h2>Suyang Liu's Code Projects</h2>
My name is Suyang Liu, and I'm an electrical engineer with a love for programming. This list contains all my GitHub Projects with a short description of each project.

<h3>GitHub Repositories</h3>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/SYLiu15/btswitch"><b>Bluetooth AC Switch</b><br></a>
  Date: 4/2019 - 6/2019<br>
  This is a native Android application written in Java using Android Studio. The app implements Bluetooth LE, implemented using Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Bluetooth code. The app is designed to control a Bluetooth enabled AC switch. App allows for individual control of each outlet and timers for each outlet on the device. The app updates all data from the device as it receives data packets.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/SYLiu15/JuniorDesignAP1_POV"><b>Bluetooth AC Switch</b><br></a>
  Date: 1/2019 - 3/2019<br>
  This firmware is designed for a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller. Device is designed with a strip of LEDs. A text string within the code is translated into arrays. Accelerometer data calculates swing speed of the wand and displays text from the array accordingly.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/SYLiu15/PredatorPreySim"><b>Predator Prey Simulation</b><br></a>
  Date: 7/2018 - 8/2018<br>
  Console application written in C++ designed to simulate the interaction between a predator and prey. Initial populations may be set. Both predator and prey move one space per round and both reproduce if they live long enough, adding another to the board. When a predator consumes a prey, the prey vanishes from the board.</li>
